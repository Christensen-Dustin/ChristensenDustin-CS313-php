    I have always enjoyed the GOD OF WAR franchise, but now I am even more interged by the growth of the main character, Kratos, as he struggles to be a father to a son that just lost his mother. A war torn character that had finally found peace and a new family, has to make his way through a hostile land, with his son, to fulfill the final request of his dead wife; to spread her ashes from the highest peak within all the realms. I look forward to see where this road takes them, emotionally.
